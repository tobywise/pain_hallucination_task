Ok, Great!
Remember:
If you hold YES button down for a long time, you are very certain that you heard a sound.
If you hold NO button down for a long time, you are very certain that you DID NOT hear a sound.

PARTICIPANT: PLEASE PRESS A BUTTON TO CONTINUE.

*There is one more difference in this second task:
On some of the trials, the fixation cross will change into a question mark instead of a checkerboard.
When that happens, you may or may not hear a voice instead of a tone.
However, you should still respond the way you did before:
YES and NO.

PARTICIPANT: PLEASE PRESS A BUTTON TO CONTINUE.

*Ok, let`s practice this as you would in the experiment itself.
