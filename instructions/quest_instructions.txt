Great job!
Now we will move on to the actual experiment.

It is important to note that the tones in the practice session were there to make sure you understood what to do, with
very loud and impossible-to-hear tones.

The tones in the remainder of the experiment may be very difficult to hear so you will have to listen very hard.
Sometimes it might be difficult to answer, but if you do not know, please guess. For this first task, you will not be
asked to rate your confidence so just quickly press and release the button as soon as the screen flashes.

PRESS the "YES BUTTON" TO CONTINUE.
